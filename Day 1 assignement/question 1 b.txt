Scripting language vs programming language
Scripting language -

Scripting languages do not require compilation step and are rather interpreted. That is we don’t need to compile it before running.
Here we don’t need convert our whole code into machine readable code at once .since it is executed statement by statement.
It reduces syntax or we can say it has smaller code compared to programming language.
When dealing with small application or small problems then it is better to use scripting languages since it is faster and consumes less memory for smaller programs.
Some examples are python, Javascript, PHP, etc.


Programming language -

Programming languages require compilation step. That is before running we have to compile the code.
Here the whole code will be converted into machine readable code when we compile it. 
It has more syntax’s when compared to scripting language.
When dealing with complex application it is better to use programming language, since it is faster for complex or big problems.
Some examples are java, c, c++, etc.
