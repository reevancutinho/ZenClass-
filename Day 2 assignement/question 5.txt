Prototype

* In simple words it is first version of a device from which other forms are developed.
* It is a physical model of the answers to the challenges that the designers have already specified and discussed during the concept stage.
* It allows designers to test their concepts by presenting whatever they have done in front of people and collect their inputs on it.
