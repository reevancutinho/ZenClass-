Difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages
Statically typed -

A programming language is said to be statically typed if type checking is performed during compile-time.
Here types are associated with variables. Which means for a variable defined using int we can only assign integer values to it.
It allows many type errors to be caught early at the development phase. 
Here once the variable is assigned to a type, it cant be assigned to some other variable of different type.
Few examples of statically typed java, c and c++.


Dynamically typed -

A programming language is said to be dynamically typed if type checking is performed during run-time.
Here types are associated with values. Which means here based on the value we assign to a variable it will consider its type.
It results in runtime type errors. Since it does not have a compilation step.
Here one variable can be assigned to another variable of different type.
Few examples of dynamically typed python, javascript, ruby and dart.
